Quote from the abstract:

> On the otherhand, we demonstrate that some other cases of reordering, which claims to be valid, are not generally valid transformations. For example, swapping a normal memory access with a consequent lock can introduce new behaviours, and thus is not a valid transformation. Another example of an invalid transformation is reusing a value of a read for a subsequent read, or an introduction of an irrelevant read. With this analysis, we establish that the JMM is still flawed, because these transformations are performed by hardware and compilers. Even Sun’s Hotspot JVM [20] performs transformations that are not compliant with the JMM.

[Relaxed-Memory Concurrency](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/index.html)

[x86-TSO: A Rigorous and Usable Programmer's Model for x86 Multiprocessors](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/cacm.pdf) (2010) Peter Sewell, Susmit Sarkar, Scott Owens, Francesco Zappa Nardelli, Magnus O. Myreen  
Abstract:

> Exploiting the multiprocessors that have recently become ubiquitous requires high-performance and reliable concurrent systems code, for concurrent data structures, operating system kernels, synchronisation libraries, compilers, and so on. However, concurrent programming, which is always challenging, is made much more so by two problems. First, real multiprocessors typically do not provide the sequentially consistent memory that is assumed by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they have relaxed memory models, varying in subtle ways between processor families, in which different hardware threads may have only loosely consistent views of a shared memory. Second, the public vendor architectures, supposedly specifying what programmers can rely on, are often in ambiguous informal prose (a particularly poor medium for loose specifications), leading to widespread confusion.
> 
> In this paper we focus on x86 processors. We review several recent Intel and AMD specifications, showing that all contain serious ambiguities, some are arguably too weak to program above, and some are simply unsound with respect to actual hardware. We present a new x86-TSO programmer’s model that, to the best of our knowledge, suffers from none of these problems. It is mathematically precise (rigorously defined in HOL4) but can be presented as an intuitive abstract machine which should be widely accessible to working programmers. We illustrate how this can be used to reason about the correctness of a Linux spinlock implementation and describe a general theory of data-race-freedom for x86-TSO. This should put x86 multiprocessor system building on a more solid foundation; it should also provide a basis for future work on verification of such systems.


Parallel programming

[Wikipedia: Non-blocking algoritm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm)

**Performance**

[Wikipedia: Amdahl's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)  

> The speedup of a program using multiple processors in parallel computing is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours (95%) of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. Hence the speedup is limited up to 20×.

Notes:

(1) According to the law the parallel improvement would be:

                        1               1
    T(1) / T(p) = ----------------- ~= ---
                    B + 1/p (1-B)       B

where 

* `T(1)` is the time of sequential execution
* `T(p)` is the time necessary when using `p` parallel processes
* `B` is the fraction of the code that is not parallelizable, ie. critical sections or such (`0 <= B <= 1`)

For instance if 10% of the code is not parallelizable, then Amdahl's law states, that at most cca. 10x improvement can be achieved even if using more then 10 processors.

(2) The above law does not take several factors into consideration. For instance what happens if `B` is not constant instead it changes as `p` changes. Sample: 

Assume that we have an input stream of numbers and we want to determine the MAX value. Assume also that the stream contains N numbers and the reading can be split into different threads. A parallel algoritm could be the following:

1. Stage 1. Read the stream in p parallel streams and in each stream determine the MAX number. Let the sequential algoritm run at `T(1) = T(N, 1) = c * N`, where `c` is some constant determined by the speed of read and the processor. Then each process run in `T(1)/p = c * N / p` time.
2. Stage 2. Determine the MAX number from the `p` MAX values produced by the  parallel streams. Again this is parallelized within the `p` processes in a B-Tree manner, which yields a `log p` time.

Hence the total time for the algoritm when using p parallel processes:

    T(1)/p + log p = c * N / p + log p

The improvement is

          c * N                p
    -----------------  = --------------------- -> p, if p fixed, N -> infinitum
    c * N / p + log p    1 + p * log p / c * N

hence Amdal's law in its original form is not true. The reason is that the parallel portion is not constant, converges to zero as N increases:

           log p
    B = ----------- -> 0, if p fixed, N -> infinitum
           c * N
