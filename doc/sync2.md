Protocol description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lets go through the protocol "building it up starting from ground":

### The simplest protocol ###

The simplest, though unsafe protocol is the following:

    # mark this selected 
    selected[i] = true

    # mark this deselected
    selected[i] = false

This is obviously wait-free but not safe.

### The safe one ###

The problem with the simplest protocol is that it does not guard against the case when the two threads enter the protocol at the same time and hence are selected in parallel. So **lets add a guard before the selection which checks whether the other thread is active or not**:

    # mark this thread as active
    active[i] = true

    # check whether the other thread is active
    if active[i + 1]:

        # if the other thread is active then wait until the other thread becomes inactive
        while active[i + 1]: yield

    # mark this selected 
    select[i] = true

    # mark this deselected
    select[i] = false

    # mark this inactive
    active[i] = false

This one is safe, that is it guarantees that threads are never selected in parallel. However it is obviously not wait-free: if both thread enters the guard simultaneously then they will block forever. But before repairing this weaknest, lets see why this protocol is safe. The reason is the following: 

**If two threads enters the protocol in parallel then one of them detects the other as active, hence goes into the wait loop.** Informally speaking the thread that activated itself later will detect the other as active. A bit more formally:

Assume that thread 0 did not detect thread 1 as active. This means that when  thread 0 issued its check `if active[1]`, at that time thread 1 was not yet active (maybe it has not yet invoked the protcol or just started marking itself active). One thing is sure that thread 1 has not yet executed its own guard. Formally the statements has the following historical order:

    active[0] = true < if active[1] < if active[0]

(where `<` means that the statement on the left was issued earlier then the one on the right). From the above history it is obvious that the last guard returns true, since thread 0 activated itself earlier. 

*Note that we must also assume that thread 0 is still active when thread 1 issues its guard, otherwise it may find thread 0 as inactive.*

### The safe and almost wait-free one ###

The problem with the above safe protocol is the case when both thread executes its guard at the same time. (At least to me) this seems to be a problem with symmetry: the system cannot really differentiate between the two threads when staying in the wait loop. So **lets break the symmetry: give thread 0 a special role, the 'waker', whose only task is to wake up thread 0**:

    # mark this thread as active
    active[i] = true

    # check whether the other thread is active
    if active[i + 1]:

        # if the other thread is waiting then in case of thread 1 mark this to wait
        if i == 0: wait1 = true

        # wait until the other thread becomes inactive or thread 0 marks this thread to not wait (in case of thread 1)
        while active[i + 1] and (i == 1 and wait1): 
            if i == 0: wait1 = false
            yield

    # mark this selected 
    select[i] = true

    # mark this deselected
    select[i] = false

    # mark this inactive
    active[i] = false

This protocol is still safe. To put it simply either thread will go into the wait loop and then does not break until (1) the other thread becomes inactive, or (2) in case of thread 1: it is not waken up. However in the latter case, thread 0, the 'waker' will stay in the wait loop until thread 1 becomes inactive.

The problem with this protocol is that it is not wait-free, only almost wait-free. There is a non zero, though low probability that thread 0 blocks forever. This could happen when thread 1 is very busy, ie. a new activation follows a previous deactivation (almost) immediately, think of the following history or such:

    active[1] = false <  active[1] = true < if active[1] < ... < active[1] = false <  active[1] = true

It could happen that thread 0 is unable to detect thread 1's idle period, hence it will see thread 1 as always being active and stay in the wait loop forever. 

### The final one ###

It looks like that by breaking the symmetry we became unfair to thread 0. So lets rebuild the symmetry in a dynamic way and make the waker role dynamic: **different threads will play the 'waker' role in different rounds**. An initial protocol might look like this:

    # mark this thread as active
    active[i] = true

    # check whether the other thread is active
    if active[i + 1]:

        # if the other thread is active then mark this to wait 
        wait[i] = true

        # wait until the other thread is deactived or marks this thread to not wait
        while active[i + 1] and wait[i]:

            # if this is the waker thread then mark the other one to not wait
            if waker == i: wait[i + 1] = false

            yield

    # mark this selected 
    selected[i] = true

    # mark this deselected
    selected[i] = false

    # change waker if this is not the one
    if not waker == i: waker = i

    # mark this inactive
    active[i] = false

This is almost good. The problem is that the role change is not yet safe. Think of the following scenario:

1. Originally thread 0 plays the waker role and it is in the wait loop just before issuing another wakeup, that is: it already issued `if waker == 0` but not yet executed `wait[1] = false`
1. Thread 1 changes the role and becomes the waker, then it 'starts executing statements very busily': before thread 0 would ever execute its next statement (`wait[1] = false`) thread 1 
1. reenters the protocol
1. detects that thread 0 is active hence 
1. enters the wait loop as well - and this is a problem since now there are two 'wakers' in the wait loop: there's thread 1 the real waker and thread 0 the fake waker, who mistakenly thinks that it is the waker - that is:
1.  thread 1 executes `wait[0] = false` which marks thread 0 to not wait, now it might slow down and let thread 0 to work, that is:
1.  thread 0 executes `wait[1] = false` which marks thread 1 to not wait
 
Now both thread is marked to not wait, hence might leave the wait loop in parallel and hence selected in parallel.

Formally a history could look like this:

    thread 0: if waker == 0   # which yields true at this time
    thread 1: if not waker == 1: waker = 1
    thread 1: active[1] = false
    thread 1: active[1] = true
    thread 1: if active[0]
    thread 1: wait[1] = true
    thread 1: while active[0] and wait[1] # now both thread is in the wait loop as a waker 
    thread 1: wait[0] = false # marks thread 0 to not wait 
    thread 0: wait[1] = false # marks thread 1 to not wait

In order to make the role change safe, the protocol adds a synchronization between the two threads: 

1. the thread who initiated the change yields that a role change is in progress, then it waits for an acknowledgement 
1. the thread who was previously the waker acknowledges the role change, when it detects it

*yielding role change*:

-- if the previous waker is active, then the changer tells it that a role change is in progress, technically it sets the corresponding flag to true:

     # if the other thread is active then tell it about the change
     if active[i + 1]:

         # yield the change
         waker_change = true

-- then the new waker goes into a wait loop until the previous one acknowledges the change:

         # wait until the other thread acknowledges the change
         while waker_change: yield

*acknowledging role change*

-- when the previous waker (staying in the guard) detects the role change, acknowledges it, hence breaks the other thread's wait loop:

    # if waker change is not in progress then mark the other thread to not wait
    if not waker_change: wait[i + 1] = false
                    
    # otherwise acknowledge the change
    else: waker_change = false

That's all:-)


Properties
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above chapter described the protocol in details, now we try to prove its features that is to say: the protocol is safe and wait-free. The proof will go like this:

1. create a formal model of the protocol
1. prove some internal properties thorough a series of lemmas wich will be helpful in the proof
1. finally prove the features 


### A formal model ###

For reasoning I use [`I/O automaton`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_automaton):

#### States ####

States are the ones those are in the pseudo code, ie.:

* `active[i]` - marks whether thread i is selected
* `wait[i]` - marks whether thread i is to wait
* `waker` - shows which thread is the waker
* `waker_change` - marks whether there is a waker change in progress
* `selected[i]` - marks whether thread i is selected

#### Events ####

For better readibility I define the `sync2` events (with their behaviours) through the original pseudo code:

    # mark this thread active
    input event activate(i) = 
    active[i] = true

    # check whether the other thread is active
    internal event is_other_active(i, i+1) = 
    if active[i + 1]:

        # if the other thread is active then mark this thread to wait
        internal event set_wait(i) = 
        wait[i] = true

        # conditional wait (with a small rewrite: moved the condition within the loop):
        while true: 

            # evaluates the wait condition and breaks if it is not true
            internal event wait_condition(i) =
            if not (active[i + 1] and wait[i]): break

            # check whether this thread is the waker
            internal event is_waker(i) =
            if waker == i:
            
                # if this is the waker then check whether waker change is not in progress
                internal event is_not_waker_change(i) =
                if not waker_change:
 
                    # if change is not in progress
                    case true:

                        # mark other thread to not wait
                        internal event unset_wait(i, i+1) = 
                        wait[i + 1] = false
                        
                    # if change is in progress
                    case false:

                        # acknowledge waker change
                        internal event ack_waker_change(i) =
                        waker_change = false

            yield

    # mark this selected 
    output event select(i) =
    selected[i] = true

    # mark this deselected
    output event unselect(i) =
    selected[i] = false

    # check whether this thread is not the waker
    internal event is_not_waker(i) =
    if not waker == i:

       # change waker to point to this thread
       internal event set_waker(i)
       waker = i

       # check whether the other thread is active
       internal event is_other_active_in_change(i) =
       if active[i + 1]:

           # if other thread is active tell it about the change
           internal event yield_waker_change(i)
           waker_change = true

           # wait until the other thread acknowledges the change
           internal event is_waker_change_acked(i) 
           while waker_change: yield

    # mark this inactive
    output event deactivate(i) =
    active[i] = false

### Assumption ###

The proof builds upon the assumption that the read-write operations of any state provide [`linearizibility`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability) (ie. setting and getting `active`, `wait` etc. is consistent):

**Assumption: If a write operation setting a state to a new value finishes before a read invocation, then the read operation must yield the this new value.** Formally:

if a write operation setting a new value (`v`) initiated by thread i finishes before the read operation initiated by (possibly another) thread j:

    invoke_set(i, state, v) < return_set(i, state) < invoke_get(j, state) < return_get(j, state, w)

then the read operation must yield the previously set value:

    v = w

Here I used the following formalism:

* `invoke_set(i, state, v)` means that thread `i` invokes a write operation on the given `state` indicating to set it to `v`
* `return_set(i, state)` means that the previous write operation finished
* `invoke_get(j, state)` means that thread `j` invokes a read operation on the given `state`
* `return_get(j, state, w)` means that the previous read operation finished and returned `w`

Note that obviously we assume that there was no other write operation between them.

### Internal properties ###

**Lemma 1: If they run in parallel, then one of the threads detects the other as active, hence enters the wait loop in the guard**.

**Lemma 2: Exit criterias of the guard's wait loop**:

1. A thread might leave the guard's wait loop 
   1. if the other thread is/becomes inactive or 
   2. if the thread is marked to not wait (which should be issued after the thread marked itself to wait)
1. A thread can be marked to not wait
   1. only by the other thread
   1. only when the other thread is in the wait loop
   1. only if the other thread is the waker

**Lemma 3: Waker role properties**:

1. The waker role is exclusive
1. If a thread was not the waker when entered the guard then it becomes the waker just before deactivating
1. If a thread exits the guard when the other thread is still active, then 
   1. the exiting thread is not the waker and 
   1. the other thread is still in the guard as a waker

**Lemma 4: If a thread does not enter or leaves the guard then it has not waken the other thread up**

**Lemma 5: If this thread was still active when the other thread deactivated then either (1) this thread will deactivate before the other reenters the protocol or (2) the other thread enters the guard.**
